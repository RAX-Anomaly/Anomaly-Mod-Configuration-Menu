	<string id="ui_mcm_desc_mcm">
		<text>Welcome to Anomaly Mod Configuration Menu. By itself MCM does nothing. MCM provides a place for other mods/addons to display a settings UI.
		\nTo the left you will see a list of mods/addons that are using MCM to do so.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ui_mcm_desc_mcm2">
		<text>Bugs with MCM or crashes with ui_mcm.script in the log are most likely caused by one of the mods/addons using MCM and should be reported to that mod/addon's author. </text>

	<string id="ui_mcm_menu_mcm_log">
		<text>Logging</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ui_mcm_mcm_desc_log">
		<text>This is a utility for addon makers that lets them move their logging out of the xray log and game console.
		\nBecause I respect your concerns about lag and SSD write cycles I have provided some controls for you to tweak how the logging behaves.
		\nLogs will be named after the script that creates them and the MCM session id number. They be created in appdata/logs/mcm/</text>

		<text>Enable MCM logging utility.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="ui_mcm_mcm_mcm_log_continuous_desc">
		<text>Logs files are normally updated in batches. This can cause some information to be lost if the game crashes. An addon maker may request you check this box to allow their log to be updated immediately.</text>

		<text>Xray log time stamp frequency.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ui_mcm_mcm_mcm_log_timestamp_desc">
		<text>MCM adds a time stamp to the xray log to make it easier to coordinate events between mcm logs and the xray log. This is the minimum time between those time stamps. If nothing else is printing to the console neither will mcm.</text>

		<text>MCM Key Binds work "Minecraft Style": click on the box, then hit a key. Clicking or Escape Key will cancel.
		\nIf the key you see does not match the key you pressed, or MCM seems to ignore some keys, you likely need to modify mcm_key_localization.ltx to reflect your keyboard layout.
		\nKeys that are assigned to more than one MCM Key Bind or to an engine key bind will be highlighted red</text>

	<string id="ui_mcm_mcm_desc_kb2">
		<text>A few notes on the red conflicting key coloring.
		\n1. It may not matter. If the keys are used in two different UI's or if one key bind only triggers when also holding shift then the fact that the key is used twice doesn't matter.
		\n2. MCM does not know what an addon may be doing with a key. YOU need to understand how an addon is using a key to know if a conflict is relevant.
		\n3. For a single pending change the color updates correctly, for multiple pending changes it may not. Apply your changes and reopen MCM to verify correct conflict status.</text>

		<text>How soon a second press of a key needs to follow a first to count as a double tap of the key. Only applies to addons that use MCM to identify double key presses. This time can affect the input delay of some single key press events and should thereby be set as small as possible.</text>
